Hey there!

My name is Vedant (also known as BladeDurman or Freyr) and I am a Java developer!

I have developed things from Discord Bots to Minecraft Mods.

Currently I know Java, HTML/CSS/JS and Python. I'm learning more advanced python right now and hopefully I can start learning C soon too.

I'mma go back to go do whatever I was about to do. Catch you later! Don't die byeeee!!!
